# Tortoise-and-Hare-race-simulator
This is a simple Python simulation of the classic Tortoise and Hare fable, 
using the random library to determine random positions for Hare and Tortoise.

This Project showcases basic Python concepts like 
functions, classes, loops, libraries, and output visualization using cute emojis.

The hare has a higher maximum speed but occasionally falls asleep. 
The tortoise moves consistently at a fixed small step size, making it more stable over many runs.

The tortoise is slow but steady.
The hare is fast but unpredictable.
Who wins? Run it and find out.

## Features

- Clear step-by-step text race visualization
- Replayable with a new outcome

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
